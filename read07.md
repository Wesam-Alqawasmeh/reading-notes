# Functions in Javascript

- **Functions** are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

## Defining Functions

### Function *declarators*

A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

- The name of the function.
- A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
- The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.


### Function *expressions*

- A function expression is very similar to and has almost the same syntax as a function declaration (see function statement for details). The main difference between a function expression and a function declaration is the function name, which can be omitted in function expressions to create anonymous functions.

## Calling functions

- Defining a function does not execute it. Defining it names the function and specifies what to do when the function is called.

- Calling the function actually performs the specified actions with the indicated parameters
