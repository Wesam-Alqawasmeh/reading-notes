-------------------------------------

## React lifecycle:

![lifecycle](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*0saPKFiTUk6W3FYp)

**1.Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?**

- Render.

**2.What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?**

- Constructor creating (component).

**3.Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates**

     Constructor => Render =>  React updates => componentDidMount =>  componentWillUnmount 


**4.What does componentDidMount do?**

- This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, it should go here. This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions.

## React State Vs Props

**What types of things can you pass in the props?**

- like arguments to functions, (data, img path, title, description,...).

**What is the big difference between props and state?**

- Props you pass it into the component (handled outside the component), the State is handled inside the component.

**When do we re-render our application?**

- When we need to change the state we should re-render that part of application.

**What are some examples of things that we could store in state?**

- Inside the form the user inputs.
