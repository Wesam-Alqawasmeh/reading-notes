# React and Forms

------------------------------------------------------

## React Docs - Forms

**What is a ‘Controlled Component’?**

- In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState().We can combine the two by making the React state be the “single source of truth”. Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.

**Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.**


- We should update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them.

**How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?**

    event.target.value

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained


**Why would we use a ternary operator?**

- To simplify the code and make it easier and more readable because the syntax of The Conditional (Ternary) Operator is more simple than If syntax.

**Rewrite the following statement using a ternary**

    statement:

        if(x===y){
        console.log(true);
        } else {
        console.log(false);
        }


    using ternary:

    x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);
