## Controlling size of images in CSS :

-  You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.

*example*

     img {
     width: 600px;
     height: 300px;}


**Alligning Images**

- Using Float Property.

*example*

    img{
    float: left;
    }



**Backgroung Images**

- allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.


*example*

    body {
    background-image: url("images/pattern.gif");}
      

**SHORTHAND Background**

- The properties must be specified
in the following order, but you
can miss any value if you do not
want to specify it:

1. background-color 

2. background-image 

3. background-repeat 

4. background-attachment 

5. background-position 


*example*

     body {
    background: #ffffff url("images/pic.gif") no-repeat top left;
    }





## Search Engine Optimization (SEO) :

- Search engine optimization (or SEO) is the practice of trying to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that your website covers.


- ON-Page Techniques : the methods you can use on your web pages to improve their rating in search engines.

- OFF-Page Techniques : Getting other sites to link to you is just as important as on-page techniques. Search engines help determine how to rank your site by looking at the number of other sites that link to yours.
