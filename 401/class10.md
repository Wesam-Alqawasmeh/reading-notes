# Stacks and Queues

---

## **Stack**: A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| push    | Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed                                                                                    |
| Pop     | Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.           |
| Top     | This is the top of the stack.                                                                                                            |
| Peek    | When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised. |
| IsEmpty | returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.                                                                                |

## Concepts

**FILO**: First In Last Out, This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

**LIFO**: Last In First Out, This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

## Queue

**Queue terminologies**:

| Term    | Meaninnig                                                                                                                            |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Enqueue | Nodes or items that are added to the queue.                                                                                          |
| Dequeue | Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.                       |
| Front   | This is the front/first Node of the queue.                                                                                           |
| Rear    | This is the rear/last Node of the queue.                                                                                             |
| Peek    | When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised. |
| IsEmpty | returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.                                                                            |

## Concepts

**FIFO**: First In First Out, This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

**LILO**: Last In Last Out, his means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.
