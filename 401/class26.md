**What’s the difference between a framework and a library?**

- Frameworks and libraries are both code written by someone else that helps you perform some common tasks in a less verbose way.
- A framework inverts the control of the program. It tells the developer what they need. A library doesn’t. The programmer calls the library where and when they need it.
- The degree of freedom a library or framework gives the developer will dictate how “opinionated” it is.
