## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

**role based access control**: Role-based access control (RBAC) is a popular mechanism to enforce authorization in applications. When using RBAC, an application developer defines roles rather than authorizing individual users or groups. An administrator can then assign roles to different users and groups to control who has access to what content and functionality.

**http cookies**: An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to a user's web browser. The browser may store the cookie and send it back to the same server with later requests.
