## Solving Problems

**A set of steps to solve a problem:**

1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.


**Read the problem completely twice**

- You want to make sure you completely understand the problem.  A good test of this is whether or not you can explain the problem to someone else.

- If you don’t understand the problem, you cannot solve it.  Do not worry about wasting time here, because the better you understand the problem, the easier it will be to solve it.


**Solve the problem manually**

- It is very important to solve the problem manually first, so that you know what you are going to automate, otherwise you are just slinging code around.  Which while can be fun, will make you look like an idiot in a programming interview and will probably cause you to sweat profusely.


**Optimize the manual solution**

- It’s well worth the effort to try and optimize the actual solution or simplify it when it is still in the most easily malleable state.What you want to do here is figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.


**Write pseudo-code or comments**

- What we want to do here is capture all the steps we created and now either put them into our editor as comments or write them as psuedo-code that we can translate to real code. By doing this, we can know exactly what the structure of the code we are going to write is going to look like which makes the job of filling in the actual code later trivial.

## Act like you make $1000/hr

- In reality, a lot of people are living a frenzied, busy life. They wear their business as a badge of honor, and brag about their full schedules. Frankly, most people prefer the little dopamine boost of checking boxes on a to-do list than actually getting important work done.

- How do you value your time?

- Take stock of the things you did this week. How many of them were worthy of $1,000/hour?

- How many activities were a true waste of time?

- Value your time at what it deserves to be. The higher the value, the more important and productive work you’ll do — and the less trivial and mindless tasks you’ll get caught in.

## How to think like a programmer

**Steps that should you do when you encounter a new problem?**


**1. Understand**

- How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.


**2. Plan**

- Don’t dive right into solving without a plan. Plan your solution!

- In programming, this means don’t start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.


**3. Divide**

- Do not try to solve one big problem. Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve. Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer). After that, simplest means this sub-problem being solved doesn’t depend on others being solved. Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots. Connecting all your “sub-solutions” will give you the solution to the original problem.


**4. Stuck?**

- three things to try when facing a whammy:

        a. Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).

        b. Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?

        c. Research: Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions).

## The 5 Whys for Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly

**How to Use the 5 Whys**

1. Assemble a Team:

- Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix.

2. Define the Problem:

- If you can, observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on.

3. Ask the First "Why?"

- Ask your team why the problem is occurring.

4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times

5. Know When to Stop.

6. Address the Root Cause(s).

7. Monitor Your Measures.
