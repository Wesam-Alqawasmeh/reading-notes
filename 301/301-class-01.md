# Introduction to React and Components

---------------------------------------------------

## What is a Component?

- A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

- A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

- A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only. That is, a software component can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties.

**Component Views**

1. Object-oriented view
2. Conventional view
3. Process-related view


## What are the charactistics of a component?

Characteristic | Description 
--------------- | -----------------
Reusability | Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications.
Replaceable | Components may be freely substituted with other similar components
Not context specific | Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.
Extensible | A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.
Encapsulated | A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.
Independent | Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.


## What are the advantages of using component based architecture?

1. **Ease of deployment**
2. **Reduced cost**
3. **Ease of development**
4. **Reusable**
5. **Modification of technical complexity**
6. **Reliability**
7. **System maintenance and evolution**
8. **Independent**

## What is props short for?

- **Props** is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

## How are props used in React?

1. define an attribute and its value
2. pass it to child component by using Props
3. render the Props Data


## What is the flow of props?

**- Props can only be passed to components in one-way (parent to child)**
