## nosql vs sql 

**Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:**

SQL | NoSQL
-------- | ---------
table based databases | document based, key-value pairs, graph databases
represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data | collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores
have predefined schema | have dynamic schema for unstructured data
vertically scalable | horizontally scalable 
caled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware | scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load

**What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?Give a real world example.**

**What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?Give a real world example.**

- NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose.

**Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

- NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

**Which type of database is best for scalability?**

- For scalability: In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic.
