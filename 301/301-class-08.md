## API Design Best Practices


**What does REST stand for?**

- Representational State Transfer (REST) as an architectural approach to designing web services.

- REST is an architectural style for building distributed systems based on hypermedia. 

- 

**REST APIs are designed around a ____.**

- *resources*, which are any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client.

**What is an identifer of a resource? Give an example.**

- A resource has an identifier, which is a URI that uniquely identifies that resource. For example, the URI for a particular customer order might be:

    HTTP

    https://adventure-works.com/orders/1

**What are the most common HTTP verbs?**

- The most common operations (verbs) are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

**What should the URIs be based on?**

-  resource URIs should be based on nouns (the resource) and not verbs (the operations on the resource).

**Give an example of a good URI.**

    https://adventure-works.com/orders // Good

    https://adventure-works.com/create-order // Avoid

**What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?**

- "chatty" web APIs that expose a large number of small resources, So it's a bad thing.

**What status code does a successful GET request return?**

- A successful GET method typically returns HTTP status code 200 (OK)

**What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?**

 
- If the resource cannot be found, the method should return 404 (Not Found).

**What status code does a successful POST request return?**

- If a POST method creates a new resource, it returns HTTP status code 201 (Created)

**What status code does a successful DELETE request return?**

- If the delete operation is successful, the web server should respond with HTTP status code 204 (No Content)
