# Passing Functions as Props

---------------------------------------------------------

## The Spread Operator

- Spread Operator is a syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a function’s arguments. in JavaScript, spread syntax refers to the use of an ellipsis of three dots **(…)** to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments.

**What is Spread Operator used for?**

1. find the largest number in an array with Math.max().
2. pass an array to a JavaScript function expecting separate arguments does not work..
3. Copying an array.
4. Concatenating or combining arrays.
5. Using Math functions.
6. Using an array as arguments.
7. Adding an item to a list.
8. Adding to state in React.
9. Combining objects.
10. Converting NodeList to an array.

***example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays***

     const arr1 = [1,2,3]
     const arr2 = [4,5,6]
     const arr3 = [...arr1, ...arr2] //arr3 ==> [1,2,3,4,5,6]


***example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array***

        let arr = [1,2,3]
        let newItem = 4
        arr = [...arr,newItem]


***example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one***

    let a = {
        name : 'wesam',
    }

    let b  = {
        age : 23,
    }

    let c = {...a,...b}

## How to Pass Functions Between Components

**In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?**

- Creating a function to change the count where the state is there.

**In your own words, what does the increment function do?**

- looping through people property in the state to check if one of the names is passed to change it's count and give people a new added value with new objects.

**How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?**

- Pass it through props .

**How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?**

    this.props.method();
